# Python NumPy

NumPy fully supports an object-oriented approach, starting, once again, with ndarray.It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object.

# Applications...
    1. A powerfull N-Dimensional array object
    2. Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.
    3. Tools for integration C/C++ and Fortran code.
    4. Useful Linear algebra, fourier transform & Random numbers capabilities.
    
NumPy only contains the one Data sturcture i.r N-D Array.

N-D array elements are Homogenous.

Elements are only be numbers i.e it can't hold string but in special case it can hold strings but we never use numpy that way.

Fixed item size.
